# Brad Frizzell Web Programming Spring 2015

## Purpose
The purpose of this git repo is to store all labs and projects from
Tufts Web Programming Spring 2015. 

## Favorite Lab or Assignment
My favorite assignment was definitely the group project, because it allowed for a ton of
creativity. Of the work in this repo, my favorite was mmap, because it was the first project
that combined client and server side together.

## Growth
This class has taken me from knowing very basic amounts about web programming, to being
proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, and MongoDB. I got out of this course exactly
what I hoped to. While I am not an expert in Web just yet, I know now how to search for 
what I don't know and teach myself moving forward. 

## Most Important Thing Learned
The most important thing I learned in this class was the separation of concerns. For instance,
how you separate the client, server, and database. Also, how you can split up different tasks
to different files, such as having your HTML page, but the CSS the completely does all the
styling work. 

## Topic for Further Research
I would like to learn a lot more about databases, and thus I am planning to take the
database course offered at Tufts (as well as Web Engineering). I want to learn how to 
utilize databases for storing mass amounts of information about individual users, and how
you can relate those users to each other, and analyze information patterns to make predictions.
