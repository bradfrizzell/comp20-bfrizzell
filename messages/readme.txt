1. This lab works properly, with the messages displaying correctly. 

2. I asked Kyle Slinger for advice/resources, and he pointed out some 
good examples to read from Ming's site.

3. I spent around 3 hours on this. 

4. It is not possible to request data from a different origin. XMLHttpRequest
 adheres to the same-origin policy, and thus the request must be made to the 
same server as the one that served the original page.
