1. What works: I get my location, send it to the datastore, get all of the other locations, 
and display everyone's locations and distances on the map. I set my location (i.e. the 
location given back by navigator.geolocation) to a picture of CarmenSandiego. 

2. I did not work with anyone. I did a lot of googling, and used Ming's geolocation example
as my starting point. 

3. I spent approximately 6 hours completing this assignment.
